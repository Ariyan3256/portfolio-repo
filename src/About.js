                Hi, I am Ariyan Banerjee, currently a sophomore at IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. My interest in technology seemed to be growing the most when I was kind of addicted to the world of FIFA Mobile. The extremely lightning fast graphics of the game just fascinated me, and the thought of creating such a game just blew my mind.

                Born in 2004, and having done my education from ICSE board initially before I switched over to CBSE board, I would not like to portrait myself as much of a scientific individual. Rather I would like to say that I love to mix up or play with many possible solutions to produce outcomes to a problem that might at times seem impossible to solve.

                I would like to thank you for stoping by to view my portfolio. This tells me that you are also a career-oriented person and wish to bring along changes in the world using technology. My immense belief lies in the fact that combined intellect and intelligence of both of us can contribute to the development of Technology in such innumerous way that can be of great potential benefits to the society.
